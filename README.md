OWAPI is a backend plugin for the social community open source software <a href="https://www.oxwall.com/" target="_blank">Oxwall</a>. OWAPI provides a restful API so external applications can talk to your Oxwall website by making HTTP requests, and get an answer in JSON format. It was developped to be used with iOS and <a href="https://github.com/Kalianey/oxapp">Android</a> applications.
